# Desktop QR Scanner

This app will scan QR Code by taking screenshot and copy the content to Clipboard. It is current available on **Linux**, **Windows**. It's supposed to work on MacOS as well but I couldn't achieve that yet.

## Prerequirements

For Linux, you need to install **gnome-screenshot**.
```
sudo apt install gnome-screenshot
```
